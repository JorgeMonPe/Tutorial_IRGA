abstract = {Global change is modifying meteorological and hydrological factors that influence the thermal regime of water bodies. These modifications can lead to longer stratification periods with enlarged hypolimnetic anoxic periods, which can promote heterotrophic anaerobic processes and alter reservoir carbon cycling. Here, we quantified aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophic processes (aerobic respiration, denitrification, iron and manganese reduction, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis) on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) production in the hypolimnion of a Mediterranean reservoir (El Gergal, Spain) under two contrasting hydrological conditions: a wet year with heavy direct rainfall and frequent water inputs from upstream reservoirs, and a dry year with scarce rainfall and negligible water inputs. During the wet year, water inputs and rainfall induced low water column thermal stability and earlier turnover. By contrast, thermal stratification was longer and more stable during the dry year. During wet conditions, we observed lower DIC accumulation in the hypolimnion, mainly due to weaker sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. By contrast, longer stratification during the dry year promoted higher hypolimnetic DIC accumulation, resulting from enhanced methanogenesis and sulfate reduction, thus increasing methane emissions and impairing reservoir water quality. Aerobic respiration, denitrification and metal reduction produced a similar amount of DIC in the hypolimnion during the two studied years. All in all, biological and geochemical (calcite dissolution) processes explained most of hypolimnetic DIC accumulation during stratification regardless of the hydrological conditions, but there is still {\~{}} 30{\%} of hypolimnetic DIC production that cannot be explained by the processes contemplated in this study and the assumptions made.},

abstract = {Freshwater reservoirs constitute a significant source of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, and a precise quantification of the magnitude of these greenhouse gas emission on an annual scale is required. This quantification must consider both temporal and spatial variability of reservoir carbon gas fluxes. In addition, it is relevant to reinforce re- search focusing on the emission of CO2 and CH4 in Mediterranean reservoirs. Here, we simultaneously measured CO2 fluxes and CH4 ebullitive and diffusive emissions in the riverine and lacustrine zones of a Mediterranean reservoir (El Gergal, Spain) throughout a complete year to quantify their magnitude, explore their spatial and temporal variability, and investigate the potential limnological and hydrological factors influencing gases emissions. Our results show that during the study year El Gergal riverine zone was a CO2 sink, while the lacustrine zone was a CO2 source. In addition, both areas were CH4 sources to the atmosphere. CO2 and CH4 fluxes in El Gergal showed a marked temporal variability, with significant differences between mixing and thermally stratified periods. CO2 emissions were significantly influenced by surface chlorophyll-a concentration and pH, suggesting the prevalent role of primary production as CO2 flux driver. CH4 emissions were influenced by hypolim- netic methane concentration and hydrological factors potentially affected by climate change, such as water renewal rate and water column depth.},
